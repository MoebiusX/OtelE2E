# OpenTelemetry Payment PoC - Context Propagation

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application demonstrating authentic OpenTelemetry context propagation in an enterprise payment processing system. The application showcases distributed tracing across a React frontend, Kong API Gateway, and Node.js backend with real message broker integration and clean architectural patterns.

## System Architecture

The application follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

**Frontend**: React-based SPA with TypeScript and shadcn/ui components
**API Gateway**: Kong Gateway (separate process) for context injection and routing
**Backend**: Express.js REST API with clean layered architecture
**Messaging**: Enterprise message broker with authentic AMQP-style processing
**Storage**: In-memory data store with full CRUD operations
**Tracing**: Pure OpenTelemetry instrumentation with authentic span creation

## Clean Architecture Implementation

### Layer Structure
```
server/
├── api/                    # API Routes & Controllers
│   └── routes.ts          # Clean HTTP endpoint definitions
├── core/                  # Business Logic Layer
│   ├── payment-service.ts # Payment processing service
│   └── message-processors.ts # Message queue handlers
├── infrastructure/       # External Dependencies
│   ├── kong-gateway.ts   # API Gateway (separate process)
│   └── messaging.ts      # Enterprise message broker
├── storage.ts            # Data persistence layer
└── otel.ts               # OpenTelemetry configuration
```

### Key Components

**API Layer**: Clean REST endpoints with proper error handling and validation
**Business Logic**: Domain services with clear separation of concerns
**Infrastructure**: External systems (Kong Gateway, Message Broker) as separate concerns
**Storage**: In-memory data store implementing clean interfaces

### Message Flow Architecture
1. **Frontend** → **Kong Gateway** (context injection) → **Backend API**
2. **Payment Service** → **Message Broker** → **Processing Handlers**
3. **OpenTelemetry** captures authentic spans across all components

### Removed Simulated Components
- All fake Kong implementations (4 different files consolidated)
- All simulated queue systems (3 different implementations removed)
- Mixed simulation/real component conflicts eliminated
- Dead RHEA/AMQP dependencies causing startup failures removed

## Data Flow

1. **Payment Submission**: User submits payment form in React frontend
2. **Trace Generation**: Frontend generates trace ID and span ID for request correlation
3. **HTTP Request**: Payment data sent to backend with tracing headers
4. **Span Creation**: Backend creates root span and child spans for operations
5. **Database Operations**: Payment, trace, and span records stored in PostgreSQL
6. **Response**: Payment confirmation returned with trace information
7. **UI Updates**: Frontend refreshes payment list and trace visualization
8. **Real-time Monitoring**: Automatic polling for updated traces and system metrics

## External Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies
- **@opentelemetry/sdk-node**: Core OpenTelemetry SDK for Node.js
- **@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node**: Automatic instrumentation
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL driver for serverless environments
- **drizzle-orm**: TypeScript ORM for database operations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Data fetching and caching
- **@radix-ui/react-***: Headless UI components
- **react-hook-form**: Form state management with validation

### Development Dependencies
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool and dev server
- **TypeScript**: Type checking and compilation
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **drizzle-kit**: Database migration and schema management
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit with the following setup:

- **Development**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend concurrently
- **Production Build**: `npm run build` compiles frontend and bundles backend
- **Production Server**: `npm run start` runs the compiled application
- **Database**: PostgreSQL module enabled in Replit configuration
- **Auto-scaling**: Configured for automatic scaling based on demand
- **Port Configuration**: Backend serves on port 5000, mapped to external port 80

### Environment Requirements
- **NODE_ENV**: Set to "development" or "production"
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string (required for database operations)
- **REPL_ID**: Replit environment identifier (enables development features)
