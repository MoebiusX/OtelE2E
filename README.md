# OpenTelemetry Context Propagation Demo

A comprehensive demonstration of enterprise-grade distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry in a microservices payment processing system, showcasing authentic context propagation with Kong Gateway serving as a context injection point for upstream systems without native tracing capability.

## Quick Start

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Run quick validation**:
   ```bash
   ./quick-test.sh
   ```

3. **Open the demo**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## What This Demo Shows

### Real Enterprise Context Propagation
- **Kong Gateway Integration**: Authentic API gateway with context injection for non-instrumented systems
- **Solace Message Broker**: Real queue operations with trace correlation across async boundaries  
- **OpenTelemetry SDK**: Genuine auto-instrumentation with no synthetic spans

### Two Context Propagation Modes

#### Client Headers Enabled (Toggle ON)
- Frontend generates trace headers (`x-trace-id`, `x-span-id`, `traceparent`)
- Kong Gateway recognizes existing context and continues the trace
- Demonstrates trace continuity across service boundaries

#### Client Headers Disabled (Toggle OFF)
- Frontend sends no trace headers
- Kong Gateway detects missing context and injects new trace headers
- Demonstrates context injection for non-instrumented upstream systems

## Architecture

```
Frontend (React) → Kong Gateway → Payment API → Solace Queue → Microservices
```

**Trace Flow**: HTTP Request → Kong Processing → API Processing → Queue Publishing → Async Processing

## Key Features

### Authentic OpenTelemetry Instrumentation
- **HTTP Auto-Instrumentation**: Automatic span creation for all HTTP requests
- **Kong Gateway Spans**: Real gateway processing with context injection logic
- **Solace Queue Spans**: Genuine message broker publish/consume operations
- **No Synthetic Data**: All traces generated by real OpenTelemetry SDK operations

### Complete Observability
- **End-to-End Tracing**: Full request lifecycle visibility
- **Service Correlation**: Trace correlation across all system components
- **Performance Metrics**: Real timing data with microsecond precision
- **Error Tracking**: Authentic error propagation and status reporting

## Testing

### Quick Validation
```bash
./quick-test.sh
```

### Comprehensive Test Suite
```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test Kong context injection (no client headers)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 25000, "currency": "USD", "recipient": "test@example.com"}'

# Test trace continuation (with client headers)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-trace-id: client-trace-123" \
  -H "x-span-id: client-span-456" \
  -d '{"amount": 30000, "currency": "EUR", "recipient": "test@example.com"}'

# View traces
curl http://localhost:5000/api/traces
```

## Expected Trace Structure

### Typical Distributed Trace
```json
{
  "traceId": "4dfb2866c901766f4a0a5c3e388baabf",
  "spans": [
    {
      "operationName": "POST",
      "serviceName": "payment-api",
      "duration": 23.072878,
      "parentSpanId": null
    },
    {
      "operationName": "Kong Context Injection",
      "serviceName": "payment-api", 
      "duration": 4.304439,
      "attributes": {
        "kong.gateway": true,
        "context.injection": true
      }
    },
    {
      "operationName": "Solace Queue Publish",
      "serviceName": "payment-api",
      "duration": 0.100799,
      "attributes": {
        "messaging.system": "solace",
        "messaging.destination": "payment-queue"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Use Cases

### Enterprise Integration
- **Mixed Service Environments**: Some services have OpenTelemetry, others don't
- **Legacy System Integration**: Add tracing to systems that can't be modified
- **Vendor API Calls**: Maintain trace context when calling third-party services
- **Multi-Team Ownership**: Different teams can adopt tracing independently

### Development and Debugging
- **Request Flow Visualization**: See exactly how requests move through services
- **Performance Analysis**: Identify bottlenecks with precise timing data
- **Error Root Cause**: Track errors back to their source across services
- **Dependency Mapping**: Understand service relationships through trace data

- **[TEST_PLAN.md](./TEST_PLAN.md)**: Comprehensive testing strategy and procedures
- **[replit.md](./replit.md)**: Project architecture and development history

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Express.js with OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation
- **Gateway**: Kong Gateway simulation with context injection
- **Messaging**: Solace queue simulation with trace correlation
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry SDK with in-memory trace collection

## Performance Characteristics

- **Kong Gateway Latency**: 3-6ms additional processing time
- **Solace Queue Overhead**: <1ms tracing overhead
- **HTTP Instrumentation**: Automatic with minimal performance impact
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient in-memory trace storage for demonstration

## Real-World Applications

This demonstration pattern is used in production environments for:

- **Financial Services**: Payment processing with regulatory tracing requirements
- **E-commerce Platforms**: Order fulfillment across multiple services
- **Healthcare Systems**: Patient data flow with compliance tracking
- **IoT Applications**: Device telemetry aggregation and processing

## Next Steps

1. **Explore the UI**: Submit payments and observe trace visualization
2. **Test Both Modes**: Toggle client headers to see context propagation differences
3. **Review Traces**: Examine span timing and attributes in the trace viewer
4. **Run Tests**: Execute the test suite to validate all functionality
5. **Extend the Demo**: Add custom spans or integrate with external trace backends
