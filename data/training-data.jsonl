{"prompt":"Analyze anomaly: exchange-api:GET","completion":"The provided trace data and correlated metrics suggest that the exchange-api service experienced an anomaly in its GET request operation. The increased error rate (2.0%) could be due to a temporary network issue, such as a brief connection timeout or a misconfigured API endpoint.\n\nCauses: Increased network latency (P99 Latency of 372ms) may have caused the HTTP request to time out and return an error response., The high error rate (2.0%) in the GET operation could be related to a temporary issue with the API endpoint, such as a temporary server overload or a misconfigured API configuration.\n\nRecommendations: Monitor network latency and response times for any patterns that may indicate a temporary issue., Verify that the API endpoint is correctly configured and functioning within expected parameters., Consider implementing error handling mechanisms to handle transient errors and reduce the overall error rate."}

{"prompt":"Analyze anomaly: api-gateway:kong","completion":"In very clear cases like this one, requesting additional info like kernel context switching, open files, out of memory killer, etc should identify the culprit at the next iteration/step."}
{"prompt":"Analyze anomaly: exchange-api:tcp.connect","completion":"Completely incorrect because as it's obvious that 0.3% is not high usage by any stretch. High CPU usage (> 0.3%) may indicate a resource-intensive task or a complex operation being performed by the exchange-api service.\n"}
{"prompt":"Analyze anomaly: crypto-wallet:HTTP GET","completion":"resource utilization was low. Was this the first request, such a warm up one? what's the statistical confidence we have in the averages?"}
{"prompt":"Analyze anomaly: exchange-api:GET","completion":"CPU was very low, so not a factor."}
{"prompt":"Analyze anomaly: exchange-api:GET","completion":"0 requests is not a high request rate, therefore irrelevant"}
