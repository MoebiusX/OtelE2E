This discrepancy may be due to excessive network usage or resource contention.\n\nCAUSES:\n- High CPU Usage: A spike in CPU utilization might indicate that the system is struggling to handle requests efficiently.\n- Insufficient Memory: The 21MB memory usage could be a sign of temporary memory exhaustion, which might be caused by an increased number of concurrent connections.\n- Resource Contention: Overloaded network resources or competing traffic might have led to excessive latency.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- Optimize CPU Usage: Consider implementing resource allocation strategies to prevent sudden spikes in CPU utilization.\n- Memory Reallocation: Ensure that the system has sufficient memory available to handle incoming requests without experiencing memory exhaustion.\n- Network Optimization: Review and adjust network configurations to reduce contention among concurrent connections."
